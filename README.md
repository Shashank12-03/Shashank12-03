# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Shashank Joshi!

a Backend Developer â€“ the role that gives me great satisfaction in solving intriguing problems and in doing which I enjoy studying about the best practices in architecture of clean systems in the scalable environments. Throughout my academic and professional experience, I have attempted to solve more than 400 DSA problems with the improvement of my analytical thinking. My time working at Algo Financials as Python Developer Intern and later at a Shway as a Backend Developer Intern has introduced me to crucial aspects of back-end architecture and API development, including working with real-time systems. I work best in positions that enable me to help in development of sound and effective structures and I am never shy from new knowledge and experience
