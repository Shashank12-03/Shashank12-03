# 👨‍💻 Shashank Joshi — Backend Sorcerer | System Whisperer | Debugging Therapist

> “If it works, ship it. If it doesn't, log it. If it shouldn't work but still does... that's production baby.”

Hey there! I'm **Shashank Joshi**, a backend developer who talks to databases more than humans and thinks REST is something you earn *after* optimizing that last API call. Currently wielding the power of **Django** and **Node.js**, I'm on a quest to build secure, scalable, and slightly magical web systems.

I don’t just write code — I **architect** digital workflows, **debate with linter warnings**, and **strategize bug hunts** like a backend Batman.

> _Fun Fact_: My debugger and I are in a committed relationship. ❤️  
> _Real Fact_: I love building backend systems that don't just *work* — they *scale*.  
> _Also_: Yes, I did prompt an LLM to help write this — because knowing how to **talk to machines** is just as important as knowing how to code them. 😉
